# sitpush
The [sit](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sit-a-beautiful-simple-meditation-timer/id1023238111?mt=8) app on iOS doesn't send notifications. Mindfulness is important to keep me straight but sometimes I get into bad habits. This little python based [pushover](https://pushover.net/) program will help keep me on the right road.

## .env
Add your own .env file with pushover settings as shown in `app.py`

## cron
Use cron to schedule when the notifications fire. Mine runs on a headless raspberry pi.
