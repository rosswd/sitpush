# sitpush
The [sit]() app on iOS doesn't send notifications. Mindfulness is important to keep me straight but sometimes I get into bad habits. This little python based [pushover]() program will help keep on the right road.

## .env
Add your own .env file with pushover settings as shown in `app.py`

## cron
Use cron to schedule when the notifications fire. Mine runs on a headless raspberry pi.
